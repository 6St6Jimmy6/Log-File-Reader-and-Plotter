I recommend putting this in "C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\PhysicsDebugger\" so you can easily access this with the Physics Debugger also.

Currently only supports up to 30 lines. 

Optimized currently for Wreckfest and log files made with https://github.com/6St6Jimmy6/PhysicsDataDebug

Load a log file. Plot it. Change the X, Y and Y2 to change what to plot on each axis.
You can go in settings and customize the values when you tick off the Defaults tickbox(es).

Drag with left mouse on the chart to zoom.
Double click right mouse button to reset zooms or use the small icons next to the scrollbars.
