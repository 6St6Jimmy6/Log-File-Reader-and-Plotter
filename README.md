Currently only supports semicolon (;) separated log files and only up to 30 lines.

Optimized currently for Wreckfest and log files made with https://github.com/6St6Jimmy6/PhysicsDataDebug

Load a log file. Plot it. Change the X, Y and Y2 to change what to plot on each axis.

Later will do zooming etc. Just a first release until got time to do more.
